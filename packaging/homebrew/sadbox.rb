# `version`, both `url`s, and both `sha256`s are rewritten on each release by

      Before first use, provision the VM image:
        sadbox setup

      On an Intel Mac, `sadbox setup` also needs Docker (it builds the guest
      kernel and the VM disk):
        https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/

      To run at login as a background service:
        brew services start sadbox
      Then open http://localhost:7070
    EOS
  end

  service do
    run [opt_bin/"sadbox", "serve"]
    keep_alive true
    log_path var/"log/sadbox.log"
    error_log_path var/"log/sadbox.log"
  end

  test do
    assert_match version.to_s, shell_output("#{bin}/sadbox version")
  end
end
